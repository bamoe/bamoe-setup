# IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions - Red Hat OpenShift Setup
This document includes instructions on how to setup IBM BAMOE on Red Hat OpenShift.

## Overview
The following scripts and Openshift YAML configuation files are made available to setup IBM BAMOE on OpenShift.  Please note that the version of OpenShift that this has been tested on is [OpenShift Local](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview) and there may be differences when setting up on normal OpenShift.  

The `scripts` folder contains a number of shell scrips that are helpful not only in the installation phase, but also during development and deployment.  There are scripts which allow you to login to the OpenShift CLI or Docker, and scripts which drive the installation process.  Each script expects a property file as it's first input parameter, and there is a sample property file in the following folder in the repository:  `platforms/openshift/ocp.properties`, so you can either update this file or create your own.  Each script uses the following syntax:

```shell
cd ./platforms/openshift/scripts
./<script-file>.sh ../default-ocp.properties
```

The following property file is supplied for you, so all you need to do is update some of the OpenShift cluster properties or the version of BAMOE you are installing, which always defaults to the latest version:

```shell
# OpenShift Cluster Properties
OCP_URL=https://api.crc.testing:6443
OCP_CONSOLE_URL=https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing
OCP_USER=kubeadmin
OCP_PASS=<password>
OCP_DEFAULT_PROJECT=bamoe-v930

# IBM BAMOE Properties
BAMOE_VERSION=9.3.0-ibm-0007
BAMOE_GROUP=bamoe-v930
BAMOE_PROJECT=bamoe-v930
BAMOE_INFRASTRUCTURE_PROJECT=bamoe-v930-infrastructure
BAMOE_APPS_PROJECT=bamoe-apps

# IBM BAMOE Maven
BAMOE_MAVEN_REPOSITORY_IMAGE=quay.io/bamoe/maven-repository:${BAMOE_VERSION}
BAMOE_MAVEN_REPOSITORY=bamoe-maven-repository

# IBM BAMOE Canvas
BAMOE_CANVAS_EXTENDED_SERVICES_IMAGE=quay.io/bamoe/extended-services:${BAMOE_VERSION}
BAMOE_CANVAS_CORS_PROXY_IMAGE=quay.io/bamoe/cors-proxy:${BAMOE_VERSION}
BAMOE_CANVAS_UI_REPOSITORY_IMAGE=quay.io/bamoe/canvas:${BAMOE_VERSION}
BAMOE_CANVAS_EXTENDED_SERVICES=bamoe-canvas-extended-services
BAMOE_CANVAS_CORS_PROXY=bamoe-canvas-cors-proxy
BAMOE_CANVAS_UI=bamoe-canvas-ui
BAMOE_CANVAS_REQUIRE_CUSTOM_COMMIT_MESSAGE=true

# IBM BAMOE Management Console
BAMOE_MGMT_CONSOLE_REPOSITORY_IMAGE=quay.io/bamoe/management-console:${BAMOE_VERSION}
BAMOE_MGMT_CONSOLE=bamoe-management-console
```

The easiest route to a clean installation is to use the scripts, which may install multiple OpenShift objects for each application, such as a config-map, deployment, service, or routes.  You can bypass the scripts and simply use the OpenShift object YAML files as is, in case you need to update a particular component of the installation, using the following syntax example:

```shell
oc apply -f ./deployments/deployment-bamoe-maven-repository.yaml
```

## OpenShift Local Configuration
The followoing configuration was used in order to test the OpenShift Local setup for IBM BAMOE:

- Memory: 25g
- CPUs: 6
- Disk: 75g

If you need to configuration your local cluster, you can use the following commands to update it's configuration:

```shell
crc stop
crc config set memory 25000
crc config set cpus 6
crc config set disk-size 75
crc start
```

## Installing Common IBM BAMOE Applications
There is a short list of IBM BAMOE applications that you should deploy to the OpenShift cluster, in order to make those applications available to the developer/business user.  These applications, while they rely on infrastructure services, do not require the infrastructure services to be deployed in any particular order.  So we can deploy all IBM BAMOE appliations first, and then add the various infrastucture services that our applications will require.

### IBM BAMOE Maven
With `IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions v9.2.x` aligning with its previous version BAMOE v8 in the downstream build model, the artifacts are no longer available in Maven Central. The artifacts are shipped as part of the product as a Container Image and Maven Repository inside the compressed file in a consumable format.  In order to build and deploy BAMOE applications, you must setup the BAMOE Maven libraries so that developers and the CI/CD pipeline can perform these builds.  There are two steps to this setup, the first being to install the BAMOE libraries as either an offline .zip file or as a container image.  The preferred method is the container image, and as such you can use the followoing scripts in order to set this up as an OpenShift route:

```shell
cd ./bamoe-setup/platforms/openshift/scripts
./setup-bamoe-maven.sh ../default-ocp.properties
```

This script will use the supplied deploymet .YAML files and create the necessary deployments, services, and routes in order for a developer to connect to the Maven libraries.  From here, you simply need to configure your local Mave settings file to point to the BAMOE Maven route in OpenShift.  Follow the guidelines [here](../../maven/README.md) in order to finalize your configuration of BAMOE Maven.

## Installing Supporting Infrastructure Services

### PostgreSQL Database

### pgWeb PostgreSQL Database Administration 

### Keycloak Identity Access Managment

### Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka has been installed in OpenShift using the Strimzi operator, in the `BAMOE_INFRASTRUCTURE_PROJECT` project.  The cluster itself is within the `BAMOE_INFRASTRUCTURE_PROJECT` namespace.  There is also an OpenShift route used to expose the Kafka Bootstrap endpoint for clients outside of the cluster.  Notably, the Confluent VS Code extension which allows you to interact with a Kafka cluster has been installed, but requires configuration. The host for the bootstrap client is `kafka-cluster-kafka-bootstrap-bamoe-v921-infrastructure.apps-crc.testing` on port 443, the HTTPS port. Because of that, a certificate is needed for the client. That certificate is in the `openshift/certs` folder called `ocp-ca.crt.
